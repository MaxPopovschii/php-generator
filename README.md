CRUD Generator for PHP ‚Äî VS Code Extension
Overview

CRUD Generator for PHP is a Visual Studio Code extension that streamlines the creation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for PHP applications. Developed with Node.js and TypeScript, it allows you to automatically generate Controller, Model, and View files using three predefined structures: MVC, REST, and FUNCTIONAL.
Features

    ‚ö° Automatic generation of Controller, Model, and View files.

    üß© Choose between three generation modes:

        MVC (Model-View-Controller)

        REST (RESTful API structure)

        FUNCTIONAL (pure functional PHP structure)

    üîß Fully written in TypeScript for performance and scalability.

    üñ•Ô∏è Simple and intuitive interface integrated into Visual Studio Code.

    üöÄ Boost productivity by eliminating repetitive coding tasks.
